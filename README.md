# TidyData

## How to get the tidy data set

Copy the unzipped folder from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip to your working directory. Then source the run_analysis script in R "source("run_analysis.r")". If the script is not in your working directory you have also to put the path to the script. Then run the script "run_analysis()". For running the script the dplyr package must be installed "install.packages("dplyr")".

## Used OS and R version

Windows 7 SP1 64bit. RStudio 1.1.423 and R 3.4.4 x64.
